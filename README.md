# Python Job Portfolio

This repository contains my Python projects aimed at building a 
professional data analytics portfolio. 
Each week I work on real-world datasets, document my workflow, and commit 
daily to GitHub.

## Week 1: World Bank GDP per Capita Analysis

**Project Goal:**  
- Source GDP per capita (current US$) data from the World Bank's World 
Development Indicators.  
- Organize the raw data in a clean project structure.  
- Load and inspect the dataset in Python using pandas to prepare for 
cleaning and analysis.

**Data Source:**  
- [World Bank DataBank – World Development 
Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)  
- Indicator: GDP per capita (current US$)  
- Countries: 217  
- Years: 25 (most recent)

## Week 1 Tasks

| Day | Task Description |
|-----|-----------------|
| Day 0 | Set up project folder structure and initial notebook |
| Day 1 | Load and inspect GDP per capita data in Python, check dataset 
shape and columns |
| Day 2 | Clean and reshape dataset (handle missing values, format 
columns) |
| Day 3 | Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create basic 
visualizations |

**Notes:**  
- Each notebook contains **step-by-step explanations** and descriptive 
variable names to demonstrate best practices in data handling and 
analysis.  
- GitHub commits are made **daily** to show progress and version control 
skills.

## Week 1 Wrap-Up

Week 1 focused on establishing a professional Python data analysis 
workflow 
using real-world economic data. The project covered data sourcing, 
cleaning, 
reshaping into tidy format, exploratory analysis, and documentation.

This week emphasized reproducibility, clear project structure, and version 
control through daily Git commits. The completed analysis serves as a 
foundation for more advanced Python workflows.
