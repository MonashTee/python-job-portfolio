# GDP Per Capita Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project that explores global GDP 
per capita trends using World Bank economic data. The analysis 
demonstrates structured data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and 
comparative insights across countries using Python.

The project focuses on:
- Long-term global trends in GDP per capita
- Country-level comparisons over time
- Growth rates and ranking changes among selected countries

## Tools and Techniques

The analysis was conducted using:
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Key techniques include data cleaning and validation, time-series trend 
analysis, and comparative growth analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators:
- Indicator: GDP per capita (current US$)
- Source: World Bank DataBank

Details on data preparation and validation are documented within the 
analysis notebook.

## Key Findings

- Global GDP per capita increased steadily over the observed period, with 
occasional slowdowns.
- Significant and persistent income disparities exist between 
higher-income and lower-income countries.
- While all selected countries experienced growth, the pace and magnitude 
varied, resulting in mostly stable rankings over time.
